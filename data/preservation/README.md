                <p>B1.5.1a Verify the degree of preservation compliance required for your project <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/2022-07/ESDS-RFC-042VERSION1.pdf?VersionId=Kgk4CUY.EB3hJTYnSuP3qQ8ns8phTxh_"><span class="underline">using Table 1 in the Preservation Content Specifications Implementation Guidance (PCS IG) document</span></a>. [DS]</p>
                <p>Three levels of expected compliance are defined: Complete, Partial and Basic, based on different program types. With a few exceptions (e.g. CSDA), most IMPACT projects will be categorized as ‘Partial.’ If your project is under a different program or funding mechanism, follow that program’s preservation requirements.</p>
                <p>B1.5.1b Organize access to the preservation content collected as required for the compliance degree identified. [DS]</p>
                <p>Necessary content is identified in <a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/2022-07/ESDS-RFC-042VERSION1.pdf?VersionId=Kgk4CUY.EB3hJTYnSuP3qQ8ns8phTxh_"><span class="underline">Table 2 of the PCS IG document</span></a>.
